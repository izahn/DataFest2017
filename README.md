Harvard DataFest Workshop 2017
==============================

**Title and Description: **

**DataFest: A Data Science Bootcamp for better research**

This Data Workshop is for anybody interested in applying skills in data
science. This includes collecting, organizing and managing, analyzing,
and finally curating and archiving data.

**When:** January, 17, 18

Week after ComputeFest; Data Science symposium on Jan 19

**Where:** CGIS-south, Tsai auditorium (150 people), 3 breakout sessions
rooms (60, 25, 25)

The data carpentry workshop will be in October, independent of this
workshop

**Who’s organizing it?**

Combining resources from the Library, research computing groups, data
science services and data management groups (and any data science
resource across Harvard who wants to contribute)

**Practical skills: Actionable in RED**

### **Planning and Organizing your project**

-   Plan from the beginning

-   Project organization & setting up protocols around naming, access,
    > etc

-   Planning for versioning (version control) of code and data

-   Documenting work: Provenance information

### **Collecting and managing data**

-   Designed vs observational/accidental data

-   What to keep and not to keep (from measurement to data)

-   Finding and getting data:

    -   Interacting with APIs

    -   Finding data through library, repositories

    -   Web scraping (when no API or download is available)

    -   Digital archives (qualitative data and digitizing
        > paper information)

-   Combining data from multiple sources

-   Navigating legal issues with data:

    -   Institutional policies

    -   Data policies, licensing, IRB, sensitive/subject data

    -   (Practical) implementation of data use agreements/policies
        > (security, access, etc)

### **Analyzing**

-   Data types

-   Learning from your data

    -   Working with quantitative data

    -   Working with big data

-   Best practices working and computing on data (GitHub, other
    > collaborative technologies)

-   Cluster computing -- best practices and code of conduct

-   How to work together without stepping on each other's toes (working
    > in project teams)

-   Visualizations and Geospatial analysis

### **Curating and Archiving**

-   Sharing, publishing and archiving materials

-   Expectations and standards around metadata and archiving materials

**Tracks:**

1)  Unstructured data: Text data

2)  Structured data: Tabular, quantitative data set, visualization

3)  Geospatial

4)  Network data
